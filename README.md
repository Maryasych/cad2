The online editor is easy to use, has two drawing modes and three modes for displaying lines. For example, you can draw both a metal table frame and a metal structure of building. Program calculates the length of each part and submits this data to a table. You can also draw a few small designs and easily combine them together. The program realizes the ability to start and finish drawing at any point on the 2D grid, to choose the scale of the 3D cube in which the main drawing of the lines (parts of the structure) occurs, with the connection points always remain visible at any zoom, it is also possible enable orthogonal view mode. 
This is a fast and easy dynamic demo with plans to export and import files and other fun and much-needed features.
